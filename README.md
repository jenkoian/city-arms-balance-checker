contribution suggestions
=========================

- Improve the look (I am no designer!)
- Offer some suggestions on drinks you can afford, e.g. if you have a balance of Â£4 suggest you have enough for a Peroni
- Add some geolocation which knows if you are in the pub and goads you into buying a pint or something
- Find some way of incriminating tidy within this, perhaps if you get a high balance you unlock a tidy badge
